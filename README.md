Now, let start with new ideas

## Project Overview
In This project we will analyzes movie data that will help us to take three different decisions to helped Microsoft with its journey to creating a new movie studio. To create any movie genres is the one of the most important part, Genres are categories for films, in other world you can say- is a combination of two genres like Comedy-Romantic, Sci-fi, ect. This analysis of the movie industry allowed me to make an informed decision about what kind of content we use for more views and TRP. What Microsoft should strive for when comparing their budget to their global gross. The runtime for each of Microsoft's movies, and finally. Microsoft can make the most of our well-informed choices to increase the likelihood that a movie will be a success. 

### Business Problem

Microsoft is one of the big company who used to creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. Now the situation is that they want to lunch a new movie studio, but they don’t know about content that creater use to creating movies. This analysis aims to help Microsoft make infromed decisions about how they should approach this new venture.

### Some of the Questions for help to slove this business problem: -

What kind of genre we using for movie

What their desired domestic gross should be when they develop their production budget

What a movie's ideal runtime should be

## Gatting data from

The data being used for this project comes from the imdb.title.basics, imdb.title.rating, bom.movie_gross, which in zippeddata. This data was provided to us through the movies database like Movie_title, studio_name, domeomestic_gross,	foreign_gross, year, genres, averagerating, Original_title,	runtime_minutes and so on. In order to convey the strategy we think Microsoft should take in order to have the best chance of success in their new conflict between giants like Disney and Netflix, we used this data to develop innovative visuals that are both effective and unique.

### The methode we use

We used the movie data that was provided to us and a variety of information relevent to our proposal. After cleaning up the data, we used seaborn and matplotlib to produce visualisations, and come up with some solution that are help Microsoft to take the decisions and simple to understand.

## Let's understand the visualisations  

The graph belows shows how the genres for Musical, Horror, Mystery, Fantasy, Family, Animation, Documentary, Biography, Thriller, History, and Romance are all above the average line for Return on investment for each genre.




Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This analysis leads to 3 recommendations

Microsoft should produce either a Musical, Animation, Fantasy, or Family movie and release it in either June or November.

Based on Microsofts production budget they should use the regression plot to aim for a worldwide gross goal that is correlated to its production budget

Microsoft should aim to make their movies anywhere between 90 and 125 minutes
